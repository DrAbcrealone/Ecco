## Basically an Economy Plugin

Ecco saves players' scores permanently, adding them to players' balance, and allows other plugins to interact with the data. Like, a buy menu plugin could deduct the currency, and a game mode plugin could also add currency to players' balance, as a reward. In the long run, it encourages players to keep on playing.

## Wait, that's it?

Definitely not. Ecco also includes a script system, pretty similar to Half-Life's `.cfg` files. All you need to do is to 

scrabble up a script out of all the commands supported, which are capable of expansion. There are some considerable commands built-in, but you could also use addons to expand them. Also, it provides a random function, which allows you to execute commands randomly.

So how should we deal with the script system? Well, it provides a easier but more powerful way to expand the customization of plugins. For example, if a buy menu plugin has included this system, players could buy more than just weapons. Like loot boxes (with the random execution function introduced), speed up, healing and even randomly killing other players.

Also, Ecco introduces a permanent inventory system, which stores the scripts that should get running when a player joins the game. So you could make a weapon permanent for some players, set a very high max health or so. And yes, this is also expandable.

## So...what can I do with it?

If you're a server operator, you could make full use of the script system and plugins with Ecco support.

If you're an advanced server operator, you could even write an addon yourself, to expand the commands of the script system.

And if you're a plugin developer, you could try to communicate with Ecco's data and invoke the script system within your plugin.

>  ** NOTE **: This is not an open-source software, since I hold the full rights to this project. With that being said, I'm always glad with people using this plugin as long as it's not for commercial use. (Like, donation to your server is fine, but you're not supposed to add their in-game balance / items that may break the experience of gameplay for this.)
